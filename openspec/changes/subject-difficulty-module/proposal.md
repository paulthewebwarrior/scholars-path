## Why

Students often lack insights into which subjects are their weakest areas and struggle to identify performance gaps between confidence levels and actual performance. The Subject Difficulty Module provides targeted analysis to help students recognize weak subjects, understand their performance relative to confidence, and prioritize study efforts effectively.

## What Changes

- New subject difficulty assessment interface where students select an academic field and enter specific subjects
- Ability to record latest quiz/test scores and self-assessed confidence levels (1-5 rating)
- Automated analysis that identifies weak subjects and calculates performance gaps between perceived confidence and actual scores
- Dashboard or results view displaying weak subjects and performance recommendations
